## FAQ

##### Do I need custom firmware for my H801 controller?
No. The only requirement is H801 must be reachable from your NodeRED via broadcast UDP traffic.

##### How do I find the MAC Address for my H801 controller?
You may use **Fing** app on iOS/Android to look it up in your network. It should be branded as 'Espressif' and usually starts with "18:FE...". [see screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/originallyus/node-red-contrib-h801/master/screenshot_fing.jpg)
